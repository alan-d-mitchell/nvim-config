Just my personal Neovim configuration. Feel free to use it!

## ⚙️ Installation

This configuration requires Neovim version `v0.11.3`. The recommended way to install and manage Neovim versions is with `bob`.

### 1. Install Neovim with Bob

**Install Bob**

First, install the `bob` version manager using `cargo`:
```bash
cargo install bob-nvim
```
